# Economics of AI Dashboard (v2)

**Failing With Purpose: A Real-World Attempt at Human-AI Collaboration**

This repository documents my attempt to build a data dashboard exploring the economic impact of generative AI. The project itself didn’t fully succeed—at least not in the way I expected. But the failure surfaced something more important: a replicable, transparent process for working with AI like a junior collaborator.

This repo is the practical companion to my [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/...), which outlines the hard lessons I learned about AI project scoping, prompt design, and managing hallucinations through documentation and iteration.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Explore how AI adoption is impacting productivity and labor using global economic indicators
- **Challenge:** Incomplete data, misleading context, and early overreliance on AI to extract and narrate meaning
- **Pivot:** Treat AI like an associate—assign roles, review output, and build workflows that balance human strategy with AI execution

## 🧠 Key Lessons (If You're Attempting Something Similar)

1. **Clarity upfront prevents drift.** Define your project like you're writing a brief for a contractor.
2. **Assign roles to AI.** The more specific your expectations, the better the result.
3. **Don’t use AI to cover your gaps.** Use it to amplify strengths.
4. **Review AI work like you would a junior analyst.** It’s not “done” until you verify it.
5. **Document as you go.** You'll need the context later—especially when things break.
