The analyzer now includes `kept_record_id` field in removal records, showing exactly which record is being preserved when duplicates are found.

### Example from Source 1:
```csv

22,12.0,percentage,2024,growth_metric,Duplicate record (keeping first occurrence),5
1154,1.0,percentage,2024,percentages,Duplicate record (keeping first occurrence),9
```

### Example from Source 5:
