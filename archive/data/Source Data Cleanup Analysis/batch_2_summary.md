## Key Findings

### Batch Statistics
- **Total Records**: 3,404
- **Records to Keep**: 330 (9.7%)
- **Records to Remove**: 3,043 (89.4%)
- **Records to Modify**: 31 (0.9%)
- **Average Quality Score**: 16.7%

### Notable Issues

1. **Source 7 - Extreme Duplication**: 
   - 2,352 out of 2,472 records (95.1%) are duplicates
   - Contains a massive duplicate group of 1,976 records with value=0.0, unit=percentage, year=2024
   - 80.7% of all values are zeros

2. **Source 8 - Minimal Valid Data**:
   - Only 1 record out of 20 kept (95% removal rate)
   - 60% zero values
   - 8 citation years detected (40% of records)
   - Contains problematic "co2_emissions" units

3. **High Zero Value Rates**:
   - Source 7: 80.7% zeros
   - Source 8: 60% zeros
   - Source 9: 7.5% zeros

### Duplicate Patterns
- Batch 2 has significantly higher duplicate rates (89.4%) compared to Batch 1 (78.2%)
- Zero-value duplicates are particularly prevalent
- Many sources have duplicate groups with hundreds or thousands of identical records

## Quality Trend Analysis

**Average Quality Scores by Batch:**
- Batch 1 (Sources 1-5): 22.4%
- Batch 2 (Sources 6-10): 16.7%

The declining quality score indicates increasing data extraction issues in later sources.

## Recommendations

1. **Source 7 Review**: The 95% removal rate suggests potential extraction errors
2. **Source 8 Investigation**: With only 1 valid record, consider if re-extraction is needed
3. **Zero Value Analysis**: High prevalence of zeros may indicate extraction artifacts

## Next Steps

Continue with sources 11-15 to complete the duplicate analysis across all sources before deeper review.
