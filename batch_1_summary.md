## Key Findings

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Records**: 1,488
- **Records to Keep**: 295 (19.8%)
- **Records to Remove**: 1,163 (78.2%)
- **Records to Modify**: 30 (2.0%)
- **Average Quality Score**: 22.4%

### Common Issues Found
1. **High duplicate rates** - Most sources had 70-80% duplicates
2. **Citation years** - Multiple instances of publication years extracted as metrics
3. **Problematic units** - "energy_unit" appeared in several sources
4. **Vague classifications** - Many "general_rate" and "percentages" needing reclassification

### Notable Patterns
- Sources with academic paper titles tend to have more citation year issues
- Larger sources (4, 2) have proportionally more duplicates
- Quality scores are consistently low (~22%) indicating significant data quality issues in the extraction

## Recommendations

1. **Review removal reasons** before proceeding with cleanup
2. **Check modified records** to ensure reclassifications make sense
3. **Consider the low quality scores** - this validates our enhanced validation approach

## Next Steps
- Review detailed analysis files for each source
- Proceed with sources 6-10 if results look appropriate
- Execute cleanup after full review
