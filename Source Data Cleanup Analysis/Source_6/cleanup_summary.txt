- Records to REMOVE: 259
- Records to MODIFY: 14

DUPLICATE HANDLING:
- Duplicate groups identified: 111
- First occurrences kept: 111
- Subsequent duplicates removed: 263

REMOVAL REASONS:
  - Duplicate record (keeping first occurrence): 255 records
  - Zero percentage likely extraction artifact: 4 records

MODIFICATION SUMMARY:
  - general_rate -> performance_metric: 3 records
  - general_rate -> ai_metric: 3 records
  - general_rate -> readiness_metric: 3 records
  - general_rate -> adoption_metric: 2 records
  - general_rate -> growth_metric: 1 records
  - general_rate -> financial_metric: 1 records
  - general_rate -> training_metric: 1 records

METADATA ENRICHMENT:

CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:
- High confidence (>0.85): 255 records
- Medium confidence (0.70-0.85): 99 records  
- Low confidence (<0.70): 20 records

DATA QUALITY IMPROVEMENT:
- Proper duplicate handling ensures first occurrences are preserved
- Context-based metric reclassification improves data categorization
- Unit validation catches common extraction errors
- Confidence scores provide transparency for review

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review the CSV files to validate proposed actions
2. Verify that important metrics are preserved
3. Check metric reclassifications and unit corrections
4. Approve or modify the cleanup plan before execution
