## Project Start Checklist

**Project Name:** _________________________ **Date:** _____________

### üîç Reality Check (First 30 Minutes)
- [ ] Asked AI: "What could go wrong with this approach?"
- [ ] Asked AI: "What data would I need for this to work?"
- [ ] Asked AI: "What's a simpler version we could build?"
- [ ] AI gave at least 3 specific concerns (not just agreement)

### üìä Data Validation (Next 30 Minutes)
- [ ] Manually opened 3 source files
- [ ] Found 5 concrete examples of needed data
- [ ] Examples found in less than 30 minutes
- [ ] Data has clear units and context

**If any unchecked:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **STOP AND PIVOT**

---

## Daily Progress Checklist

**Day:** _____ **Hours Spent:** _____ **Working Output?** Y/N

### Morning Questions
- [ ] "What did we learn yesterday that changes our approach?"
- [ ] "What's the biggest risk in today's plan?"
- [ ] "Should we pivot based on what we know?"

### 4-Hour Check
- [ ] Have working prototype (ugly is fine)
- [ ] Can demo one real feature
- [ ] Data supports the approach
- [ ] AI has raised new concerns

**If any unchecked after 4 hours:** üîÑ **PIVOT MEETING REQUIRED**

### End of Day
- [ ] Documented what didn't work
- [ ] Updated approach based on learning
- [ ] Have something to show (not just code)
- [ ] Know tomorrow's pivot triggers

## Pivot Decision Matrix

| Factor | Stay Course ‚úÖ | Must Pivot üîÑ |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Data Quality | Found needed examples | Can't find examples |
| Working Output | Have ugly prototype | Nothing works yet |
| Time Investment | <4 hours | >4 hours no output |
| AI Feedback | "Proceed with caution" | "This won't work" |
| Scope Creep | Same as yesterday | Expanding daily |

**Pivot Score:** _____ checks in "Must Pivot" = **ACTION REQUIRED**

## Delivery Checklist

### Honest README Requirements
- [ ] "What we built:" (specific and limited)
- [ ] "What we didn't build:" (original scope)  
- [ ] "Why we pivoted:" (data/time/reality)
- [ ] "Lessons learned:" (for next team)
- [ ] "What would be needed for full version:"

### Success Metrics (New Definition)
- [ ] Identified problems in first 2 hours
- [ ] Pivoted before sunk cost trap
- [ ] Delivered something real
- [ ] Documented failures honestly
- [ ] AI challenged approach multiple times

## The TARS Setting Check

**Current AI Honesty Level:**
- [ ] 0-25%: "You're absolutely right!"
- [ ] 25-50%: "That sounds good, but..."
- [ ] 50-75%: "I have some concerns..."
- [ ] 75-100%: "That won't work. Here's why..."

**Target:** 100% for all reality checks

**Activation Phrases:**
- "Give me brutal honesty"
- "Why will this fail?"
- "Criticize this harshly"
- "What am I missing?"

---

## Red Flags Checklist

**STOP if you notice:**
- [ ] AI agrees with everything
- [ ] Haven't looked at raw data yet
- [ ] Building features before validation
- [ ] Explaining why bad data will improve
- [ ] "Just one more day" thinking
- [ ] No working output after 4 hours
- [ ] Scope growing not shrinking

---

## Meeting Template

**AI Project Reality Check Meeting**

1. **Demo** (2 min): Show working output or explain why none
2. **Data Reality** (3 min): Show actual examples or lack thereof
3. **AI Critique** (2 min): Share AI's strongest objections
4. **Pivot Decision** (3 min): Continue, adjust, or abandon?

**Total: 10 minutes to save days of wrong direction**

*Based on the Economics AI Dashboard project that failed successfully*

**Remember:** It's better to pivot in hour 4 than persist to day 4

**The Golden Rule:** If AI isn't telling you what's wrong, you're using it wrong
