# 📄 Documentation Folder

This folder contains internal documentation that reflects the iterative process of building the *Economics of AI Dashboard (v2)*.

### 🔍 What You'll Find Here

- **Process Notes**: Running commentary on project decisions, pivots, and breakdowns.
- **Prompt Design Guides**: Structured examples of how roles were assigned to GenAI agents.
- **Session Commentary**: Reflections on the quality, outcome, or failure of specific prompt interactions.
- **Workflow Templates**: Standardized formats for prompt logging, AI task assignment, and response tracking.

### 🧠 Why This Matters

The point of this folder isn't to showcase polished code—it's to expose how generative AI actually performs under project pressure. Most GenAI demos skip the messy middle. This is that middle.

If you're trying to operationalize LLMs into your own research or data workflows, these documents can help you avoid the common traps I fell into.

### 📌 Suggested Use

- Browse `Brutally_Honest_Guide` version 1 and 2 to see role-structured examples.
- Read `Case_Study_Process_Leadership` to understand the turning points.
- Use `STANDARD_OPERATING_PROCEDURES`  version 1 and 2 to structure your own projects with AI agents.
