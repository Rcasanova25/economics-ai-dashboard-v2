# 🧠 AI Session Logs

This subfolder contains raw logs from my direct interactions with large language models (LLMs) throughout the dashboard development process.

### 🔍 What's in Here

- **Timestamped Prompt Logs**: Full conversational sessions, including system role setup, prompt design, response tracking, and commentary.
- **Interaction Failures**: Cases where AI misunderstood the goal or returned misleading/incoherent output.
- **Breakthroughs**: Notable examples of prompts that significantly improved output quality or clarity.

### 🧠 Why I Logged These

AI’s value depends entirely on how you use it. Logging these sessions gave me:
- A record of mistakes I could learn from
- A clearer understanding of how prompting structure affects performance
- A transparent artifact for others trying to collaborate with GenAI

### 🔍 Suggested Use

- Browse `*_session.md` files to see different prompt structures and failures.
- Compare early vs. late prompts to understand how the workflow matured.
- Use this log structure to build your own prompt tracking system.
