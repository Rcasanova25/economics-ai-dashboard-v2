# Week 2 & Week 3 Summary: Economics AI Dashboard Project

**Date:** January 19, 2025  
**Project Goal:** Demonstrate economic analysis capabilities to frontier AI companies through a data-driven dashboard

---

## Week 2 Accomplishments (Completed) âœ…

### 1. PDF Processing Pipeline
- **Built 6 specialized extractors** for major sources:
  - Stanford HAI
  - OECD
  - McKinsey
  - Goldman Sachs
  - Academic papers
  - Universal (fallback)

### 2. Data Extraction Results
- **Processed 22 PDF sources**
- **Extracted 12,258 total metrics**
- **Key metrics breakdown:**
  - 4,536 general rates
  - 3,340 percentages
  - 810 investment-related metrics
  - 480 dollar amounts
  - 476 growth rates

### 3. Database Implementation
- **SQLite database** with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **4 tables created:**
  - `data_sources` (22 sources)
  - `ai_metrics` (12,258 metrics)
  - `conflicting_metrics` (16 conflicts)
  - `extraction_logs` (78 logs)

### 4. Key Issues Discovered
- Stanford HAI extractor initially only found 2 metrics (fixed with conversion script)
- Many metrics are actually raw statistics without clear economic meaning
- Data quality varies significantly by source

### 5. Technical Deliverables
- Complete PDF extraction pipeline
- Database with 12,258 data points
- Import/export functionality
- Basic dashboard connected to real data

## Week 3 Plan (Revised Based on Data Reality) ðŸ”„

### Primary Focus: Data Quality & Economic Sense-Making

#### 1. Data Cleaning Tasks
- **Remove duplicates** - Same metrics appearing multiple times
- **Identify outliers** - Values that don't make economic sense
- **Categorize properly** - Many "general_rate" and "percentages" need proper classification
- **Validate units** - Ensure billions vs millions are correct
- **Check years** - Some data points have unrealistic years (2030?)

#### 2. Economic Analysis Tasks
- **Context review** - Read the context field to understand what each metric actually represents
- **Source verification** - Ensure metrics match their original PDF sources
- **Trend validation** - Do the time series make economic sense?
- **Conflict resolution** - Understand why sources disagree

#### 3. Data Restructuring
- **Create meaningful categories:**
  - AI adoption rates (by sector, region, company size)
  - Investment flows (VC, corporate, government)
  - Productivity impacts (by industry)
  - Employment effects
  - Cost/benefit analysis
  
- **Add economic metadata:**
  - Is this a forecast or historical data?
  - What's the methodology?
  - What's the sample size?
  - Geographic scope

#### 4. Dashboard Refinement
Once data is clean:
- **Tell the economic story** - Not just numbers
- **Add interpretive text** - What do these trends mean?
- **Create meaningful comparisons** - YoY growth, sector differences
- **Highlight insights** - What would an economist find interesting?

## Key Insights from Initial Data Review

### Investment Data Issues
- 810 investment metrics but many are unclear
- Mix of units (millions, billions, percentages)
- Some values seem unrealistic (outliers)
- Context often missing or vague

### Metric Classification Problems
- 4,536 "general_rate" - What are these?
- Need to map to economic indicators:
  - GDP impact
  - Productivity gains
  - Cost savings
  - ROI metrics
  - Adoption rates

### Source Quality Variance
- Academic papers: High detail, small sample
- McKinsey/Goldman: Business focused
- Stanford HAI: Comprehensive but needed fixes
- OECD: Policy perspective

## Week 3 Deliverables

1. **Cleaned dataset** with clear economic meaning
2. **Data quality report** documenting issues and fixes
3. **Economic narrative** - What story does the data tell?
4. **Polished dashboard** showing real insights, not just raw numbers
5. **Methodology document** - How you cleaned and interpreted the data

---

## Strategic Value for AI Companies

This project demonstrates:

1. **Economic thinking** - You don't just extract data, you understand it
2. **Data quality awareness** - You catch and fix issues
3. **Domain expertise** - You know what metrics matter for AI economics
4. **Technical capability** - You can build the tools you need
5. **Communication skills** - You can tell the story behind the numbers

The messy reality of the data (vs. clean demo data) actually strengthens your case - it shows you can handle real-world complexity.

## Next Steps

1. Export all data to CSV for thorough review
2. Create data cleaning scripts with clear documentation
3. Build economic categories that make sense
4. Update dashboard to show cleaned, meaningful data
5. Write economic insights report

**Remember:** The goal isn't just to show technical skills, but to demonstrate that you think like an economist who can code, not a coder trying to do economics.
