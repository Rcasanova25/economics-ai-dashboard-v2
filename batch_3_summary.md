## Key Findings

### Batch Statistics
- **Total Records**: 1,404
- **Records to Keep**: 391 (27.8%)
- **Records to Remove**: 982 (69.9%)
- **Records to Modify**: 31 (2.2%)
- **Average Quality Score**: 23.6%

### Notable Patterns

1. **Source 12 (HAI AI Index)** - Highest quality in batch:
   - Best quality score: 36.5%
   - Still 63.5% duplicates
   - Contains investment and dollar amount metrics

2. **Source 14 (NVIDIA)** - Minimal valid data:
   - Only 5 records kept out of 38 (86.8% removal)
   - Contains problematic "multiple" units (16 records)
   - Very small dataset

3. **Improved Quality vs Batch 2**:
   - Batch 3 average: 23.6%
   - Batch 2 average: 16.7%
   - Better than Batch 2 but still below Batch 1 (22.4%)

### Unit Issues
- Source 12: "unknown" units detected
- Source 14: "multiple" units (likely comparison ratios)

## Cumulative Analysis (Sources 1-15)

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Records Analyzed**: 6,296
- **Total to Keep**: 1,016 (16.1%)
- **Total to Remove**: 5,188 (82.4%)
- **Total to Modify**: 92 (1.5%)

### Quality Trend
```
Batch 1 (1-5):   22.4% average quality
Batch 2 (6-10):  16.7% average quality  
Batch 3 (11-15): 23.6% average quality
Overall (1-15):  20.9% average quality
```

## Observations

1. **Consistent High Duplicate Rates**: 82.4% overall removal rate
2. **Source Quality Varies Widely**: From 5% (Source 8) to 36.5% (Source 12)
3. **Zero Values Common**: Especially in duplicate groups
4. **Citation Years**: Detected across multiple sources
